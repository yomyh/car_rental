Car Rental System
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Car Rental System Project.

Project Overview:
The car rental system allows users to rent cars for a specified number of days. It includes functionality for logging in, selecting a car to rent, entering customer information, calculating rental fees, and displaying rental information.

Features:
User Authentication:

Users are required to enter a password to access the system.
Access is granted only if the correct password is entered.
Car Data:

The system stores data about different car models including their names, colors, models, maximum speeds, prices, and manufacturing dates.
Customer Information:

Users can input their name, address, phone number, ID, and driver's license information.
Car Selection:

Users can choose from a list of available car models to rent.
Rental Calculation:

The system calculates the rental fee based on the selected car model and the number of days the car will be rented for.
Rental fees are calculated by multiplying the daily rental price of the selected car model by the number of days rented.
Display Rental Information:

The system displays detailed information about the rental transaction including the customer's name, the selected car model, the number of days rented, and the total rental fee.
File Handling:

The system uses file handling to store and retrieve data about cars and customers.
It creates separate text files for each car model to store their details.
User Interface:

The system provides a basic text-based user interface for interaction.
Users can navigate through menu options to perform various tasks such as renting a car and entering customer information.
Error Handling:

The system handles invalid inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
For example, if an invalid car model is selected, the system prompts the user to try again.
Welcome Message:

The system displays a welcome message and loading screen when it starts up.

Getting Started
1) Set up your development environment with a C++ compiler and IDE.
2) Understand project requirements and plan your approach.
3) Implement features like user authentication, car data management, and customer information handling.
4) Develop rental fee calculation mechanisms and error handling.
5) Thoroughly test the system, considering enhancements for usability.
6) Document your code and finalize the project for deployment.
